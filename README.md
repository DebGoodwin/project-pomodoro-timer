### Pomodoro Timer

The initial screen allows the user to set the length of the focus and break sessions. 

At the end of each interval, an alarm will sound and the next interval will begin. The timer can be paused or stopped at any time during an interval.

The stop button is disabled until a new session has been started.

The session timer shows the type of session, the duration of the session, time remaining, and a progress bar.
